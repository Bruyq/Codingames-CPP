# Codingames-CPP
A repository that contains my solutions for some codingames problems in C++.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All my codes are made to run in any IDE, if you want to run my code in codingames, you might have to make small changes to the main function or the file structure of my code depending on the problem.
