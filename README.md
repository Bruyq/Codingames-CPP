# Codingames-CPP
A repository that contains my solutions for some codingames problems in C++.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All my codes are made to run in any IDE, if you want to run my code in codingames, you might have to make small changes to the main function or the file structure of my code for some problems.  

|Problem name|Difficulty|Themes|Description|

| **Unary** | Easy | Unary encoding | Given a message (string), give the unary code corresponding to the ASCII character of the message as an output |
| **MIME Type** | Easy | Hash Tables, associative tables | Given a number n of element used to make up an association table (int), a number q of files to be analyzed (int), n lines of file extensions and their corresponding MIME Type and q lines of filenames, give as an output the corresponding MIME Type for each filename |
| **Defibrillators** | Easy | String manipulation, geometry | Given a longitude (string), a latitude (string), a number of defibrillators (int) and the description of each defibrillator (string), give as an output the name of the nearest defibrillator |
| **Six degrees of Kevin Bacon** | Easy | Graphs, Breadth-First-Search | Given the name of an actor (string), a number of films nb (int), and nb lines of a film with its actors (string), give as an output the minimum number of movie needed to link the given actor with Kevin Bacon |
| **BinarySearchTreeTraversal** | Medium | Binary tree, Graph traversal, Breadth-First-Search | Given a number of element (int) and a sequence of integers, build a binary tree and give as an output the traversal of this tree in Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order, Level-Order |
